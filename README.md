<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>This project was inspired by Dave Gray's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxcTsOHrjo&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6M8znNpim8dRiICRrP5HPft&index=6">Tailwind CSS video tutorial</a> but ultimately, I decided to take things in my own creative (and flavorful) direction.
The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with Tailwind CSS's constraint-based utility classes.</p>
